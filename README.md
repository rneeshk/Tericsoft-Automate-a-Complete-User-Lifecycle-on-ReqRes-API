# Tericsoft-Automate-a-Complete-User-Lifecycle-on-ReqRes-API

# ReqRes API Test Automation Suite

This repository contains a comprehensive API test automation suite for the [ReqRes.in](https://reqres.in/) mock API. The project demonstrates a complete user lifecycle scenario (Create, Update, Get, Delete) and is implemented using two industry-standard approaches:

1.  **Java REST Assured Framework:** A robust, code-based solution built with Java, Maven, and JUnit 5.
2.  **Postman & Newman:** A tool-based solution using Postman for request creation and Newman for command-line execution.

This project is designed to showcase best practices in API test automation, including configuration management, data-driven testing, advanced reporting, and CI/CD readiness.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Dual Implementation:** Solves the same problem using both a coding framework and a testing tool.
*   **CI/CD Ready:** Both solutions are designed to be executed from a command-line interface, making them perfect for integration into pipelines like Jenkins.
*   **Externalized Configuration:** No hardcoded data. API keys and base URLs are managed in external configuration files (`config.properties`) and Postman Environments.
*   **Data-Driven Testing:** Demonstrates the ability to run tests with data from an external CSV file.
*   **Advanced HTML Reporting:** Integrated with the **Allure Framework** to generate beautiful, interactive, and detailed test reports.
*   **Robust Validation:** Includes advanced checks like **JSON Schema validation** to ensure the integrity of API response structures.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following software installed:

1.  **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Version 1.8 or higher
2.  **Apache Maven** - To build the project and run tests
3.  **Allure Commandline** - To generate the HTML test report
4.  **Node.js & Newman** - To run the Postman collection from the command line

## 🚀 How to Run the Tests

### Method 1: REST Assured Framework (via Maven)

This is the recommended way to run the full Java test suite.

**Step 1: Navigate to the Project Root**
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this project.

**Step 2: Run the Tests**
Execute the following Maven command. This will clean the project, compile the code, and run all tests.

```bash
mvn clean test
```

You will see detailed logs in the console. The build will end with a **`BUILD SUCCESS`** message.

**Step 3: View the Allure Report**
After the tests have run, generate and view the interactive HTML report by running:

```bash
allure serve
```
This command will open the report in your default web browser.

---

### Method 2: Postman Collection (via Newman)

This method runs the Postman tests from the command line, simulating a CI/CD environment.

**Step 1: Navigate to the Postman Directory**
From the project root, navigate into the `postman` directory.

```bash
cd postman
```

**Step 2: Run the Collection**
Execute the following Newman command. This runs the collection using the variables from the specified environment file.

```bash
newman run "ReqRes User Lifecycle.postman_collection.json" -e "ReqRes QA Environment.postman_environment.json"
```
A summary of the test run, including all assertions, will be printed directly to the console.

##  Deliverables Test Deliverables Summary

### 1. Automation Suite (Source Code)

*   **REST Assured Framework:** A complete Maven project is located in the `src` and `pom.xml` files.
*   **Postman Collection:** The collection and environment files are located in the `/postman` directory.

### 2. Test Execution Reports

*   **Allure Report:** Generated by running `mvn clean test` followed by `allure serve`. It provides a detailed, interactive view of the test results.
*   **Newman Log:** The console output from the `newman run` command serves as the execution report for the Postman suite.

### 3. Documentation

*   This `README.md` file serves as the central documentation for the project, including the test strategy, setup guide, and execution instructions.
